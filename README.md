Succinct Style for Textual
==========================

Succinct is a [solarized dark](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme for the Textual IRC client based on the [Colloquy theme of the same name](https://github.com/TempSpas/succinct-for-colloquy). The code was built off of the [Sulaco](https://github.com/rgrove/textual-sulaco) dark theme. The theme is still in beta, so expect some kinks here and there. **Note:** The style is currently being worked on for Textual 7.0.3.

## Features

* Simple, clean design that emphasizes what you need and de-emphasizes what you don’t.

* Doesn't overwrite any of your preferences. Want to use a light UI with Succinct?
  You can. Want to change how nicknames or timestamps are formatted? Great! The theme is unobtrusive.

* Coalesces multiple consecutive messages from the same sender rather than
  displaying the same nickname over and over.

* Provides handy start and end markers for ZNC playback.

* Plucks the ugly in-message timestamps out of ZNC playback and puts them in the
  timestamp column where they belong.

## Installing

1. [Download the Succinct theme](https://github.com/TempSpas/textual-succinct/archive/master.zip)

2. Open Textual's preferences. Go to Addons->Installed Addons and click the
   "Open in Finder" button next to the "Custom Addons Location" label.

3. Browse to Textual's `Styles` directory.

4. Extract the Succinct theme here, into its own folder (rename it if you don't
   like GitHub's autogenerated archive name).

<!-- NOTE: The theme currently displays the full topic bar at all times. If you wish to have it display a shortened version that lengthens upon hovering, uncomment the lines marked at 576 and 584. -->

## TO-DO

* Tweak highlight message color.

* Change style/color of /whois messages.

* Add compatibility for scrollback buffer introduced in beta versions.

* Make changes to inline images. Should have a more uniform alignment pattern.
